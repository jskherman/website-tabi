## Not-so-obvious names

**TIL** that the image service [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) is pronounced "imager" and not "im-gur" as I've been saying it in my head for a while now.[^1] It's not a big deal but it's one of those things that aren't obvious until you hear someone say it out loud. Just like [nginx](https://nginx.org) is pronounced "engine-x" and not /ŋɪŋks/.[^2]

Surprising, right? I had to resort to using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) here to represent the pronunciation of nginx I was trying to convey. Most native English speakers are not even explicitly aware of the "ŋ" sound on its own.[^3] 

## Risk of hotlinking

**TIL** that hotlinking images from random sites is risky. I've done this in the past but when you think about it, the owner of the site that you're hotlinking from can just change the image to something inappropriate or malicious with the same filename. Same goes for other resources like audio, video, and JavaScript files.

Maybe it would be better to save a copy of the resource, host it yourself, and just credit the original source. Thus, even if the original source changes the image, you still have the original version. There's the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) to help corroborate the original source if needed. The problem here now is the bandwidth cost of hosting the image, especially if you're using something like [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) (AWS S3-compatible object storage).

For more information, read the [Wikipedia page on hotlinking or inline linking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Inline_linking).
