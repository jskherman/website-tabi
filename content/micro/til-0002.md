## Sections in VS Code's Minimap

**TIL** that in the [March 2024 (version 1.88) release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_88) of VS Code, you could now have [section headers/labels in the minimap](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_88#_minimap-section-headers) by using comments that exactly start with `MARK:` which might prove useful in large files.

## Vivianite

**TIL** of the blue/green mineral [Vivianite](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vivianite) which is a hydrated iron phosphate mineral found in a number of geological environments. I encountered [an article on the said mineral](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/vivianite-blue-human-remains) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40232171) about it being found sometimes in places where corpses are buried within waterlogged environments that are low in oxygen and high in iron-containing minerals.

Someone raised the question of whether the mineral could be an alternative to a person's "ashes" as a [commemorative item described as a "soul crystal"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40235288). Instead of cremation, the body could instead have its phosphorus extracted and used for the synthesis of a vivid vivianite crystal in the lab. Ironically, the mineral was either named after the Welsh-Cornish politician/mineralogist John Henry Vivian or Jeffrey G. Vivian, an English mineralogist. With the name "Vivian" likely having roots in the Latin word "vivus" meaning "alive" or "living".

## Moefication of Logos

A logo takeover by [@sawaratsuki1004](https://twitter.com/sawaratsuki1004). There's also some logos done by [@Aikoyori](https://twitter.com/Aikoyori) here in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aikoyori/ProgrammingVTuberLogos).[^1] There's [React](https://react.dev/?uwu=true), [Hono](https://hono.dev/?kawaii=true), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/?kawaii=true). Just a fun trend in logo design recently. Corporate logos are too common nowadays and it's nice to see a bit of fun, creativity, and personality in the design of logos.
