{% admonition(type="info") %}

A caveat: for cells that only have rowspans (no unit cells), they will not span the proper cell size (and produce a wrong output) in Typst because the row height is `auto`. A suggested workaround is by assigning a fixed height to the rows in the output table in Typst (e.g. `table(rows: 2em)`).
