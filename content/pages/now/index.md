## I'm Working On

- `2023-12-04` I have switched over my quantified self site to use [Holoviz's Panel library](https://panel.holoviz.org) to create the dashboards. I'm planning to add more data sources and pages to it when I have free time. I currently have on there a page tracking how much time I have spent studying for the Chemical Engineering board exam.

- `2023-12-05` I'm currently working on adjusting my body clock to wake up earlier for the review. I found that it was easier to do in a new environment than when I was at home, despite both places of sleep having no access to sunlight.

- `2023-12-15` Working on some small tweaks/fixes on the side for my [résumé/CV template](https://github.com/jskherman/cv.typ) made with $\ \xcancel{\LaTeX} \ $ [Typst](https://typst.app). I sometimes find myself checking the repository to see if it has reached 100 stars yet. It's currently at 97 stars on `2023-12-27`. Imaginary internet points, lol. It got featured on Twitter by the [Typst team](https://twitter.com/typstapp), which made me a bit enthused.

## Reading Now

None at the moment. It's review materials because of the board exams.
