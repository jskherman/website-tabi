👋 Hi there! Welcome to my weblog.

I'm [Je Sian Keith Herman](#firstname) and I'm your simple enjoyer of 🍨&nbsp;ice&nbsp;cream, ☕&nbsp;iced&nbsp;coffee, and 🍹&nbsp;iced&nbsp;tea. I recently graduated from [Bicol University](https://bicol-u.edu.ph/) with a degree of Bachelor of Science in [Chemical&nbsp;Engineering](https://www.icheme.org/education/whynotchemeng/).

This is the site where I share my thoughts, tools, interests, projects, showcases, experiences, etc. Check out
the [archive](@/archive/_index.md) for a list of some of it. Feel free to reach out and give feedback through [email](#email-link) or any of my [contact details](#socials).

## What's on here?

I am still building up the contents here on this website from time to time. For now, here's some links to things on this site that might be of interest that I have already built up:

- The [Gists](@/gists/_index.md): if you're looking for code snippets and random pieces of text.
- The [μ-blog](@/micro/_index.md): I don't, of course, just post long-form articles, but also short notes and thoughts.
- My [Curriculum Vitae](https://go.jskherman.com/cv): if you're looking for it.
- The [Now page](@/pages/now/index.md): if you're looking up what I am up to these days.[^1]
- The [Web Archive](https://webclips.jskherman.com): if you're looking for a collection of links that I found interesting and have saved.
