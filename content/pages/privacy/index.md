## What data do we collect?

While browsing the site, no personal information is collected. If you use our website, we may collect publicly available information about your IP address and the browser youâ€™re using.

We might also collect the type of mobile device you are using, or the version of the operating system your computer or device is running.

### Comments {#what-comments}

We do not collect any data when you send a comment or reaction, but GitHub does in order to provide the service.

For website improvement, the following non-personal data is collected:

- **Referrer**: the source that led you to this site.

- **Screen size**: the dimensions of your device's screen.

## How will we use the data?

The data sent to GitHub is used to display your comment on the site.

The non-personal data is used to generate statistics about the site, such as the number of visitors per day, or the most popular pages and referrers. This data is used to improve this site and its contents.

All data collected is publicly available, either in the form of comments or statistics.

The information you provide might also be used to contact you in order to respond to queries and requests. We may use information to protect the site owner, our readers, or our websites.

We do not use the data for any other purpose. We use information as otherwise permitted by law.

## Will the data be shared with third-parties?

We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. We will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share it if a government agency or investigatory body requests. Or, we might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud.

We might share information with our business partners. This includes a third party who provide or sponsor an article, or who operates an affiliate program. Our partners use the information we give them as described in their privacy policies.

## How do we store the data?

The data is stored on GitHub servers. See the [GitHub's privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

The analytics data is stored on a server hosted by [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). The server is located in Los Angeles, California, USA ([`lax` region](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/)).
