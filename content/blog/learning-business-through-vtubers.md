## My Journey into the Vtuber Rabbit Hole

In one of my procrastination web surfing journeys, I stumbled upon the world of VTubers through the serendipity of the YouTube recommendation algorithm. At first, it was just the funny clips, memes, and video game streams. However, I was pulled deeper into the rabbit hole when **Kurosanji** (a.k.a. Nijisanji), a VTuber company, recently faced backlash in February 2024 due to a _extremely_ poor and distasteful PR move involving one of their talents. What is a VTuber you ask? Well, it's a virtual YouTuber or streamer in the form of a digital avatar that is controlled by a real person and is often used for streaming and content creation. The pros of which allow for the talent to maintain a level of anonymity and privacy while still engaging with their audience.

Anyway, as I delved deeper into the situation, I found myself reading comments on Reddit and YouTube, as well as watching video reports on the worsening situation for **Kurosanji**. This led me to encounter various discussion points related to:

- Business fundamentals and stock analysis
- Business and talent management
- Public relations and community engagement
- Legal aspects, including contract nuances on enforceable clauses and local/international jurisdictional implications

In particular, the discussions were related to this [particular PR disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTAL-8v_HsQ) and how **Kurosanji**'s handling of the situation in their English branch (known as Nijisanji EN) was as bad as you could imagine. The situation was so bad that it led to a significant drop in their stock price once [their recent Fiscal Year 2024 Q3 report](https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/5032/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym2/152505/00.pdf) and [accompanying presentation](https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/5032/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym3/152506/00.pdf) was released, along with a loss of trust from their audience and from some investors. Notice, how on page 6 of the [IR presentation](https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/5032/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym3/152506/00.pdf) in the chart on the right, the year-on-year growth of the English branch is at a whopping -40.3% despite experts saying that Q3 is usually the most profitable quarter for the company historically.

The stock price almost plummeted to an all-time low if it were not for the existing controls put in place by the Japanese government to prevent a stock price from falling too quickly. At one point, there was a limit on who could sell the stock to prevent a further drop in the stock price as well as on those who could [_short_ the stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp) (because who _wouldn't_ in this situation? It was too profitable and predictable). Just look at the cliff in the [stock price chart of Anycolor](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/5032.T) (the corporation behind **Kurosanji**) at around March 14-15, 2024, but the downward trend already started at the start of February 2024 when the event started. The situation was so bad that the CEO of Anycolor [had to issue a public apology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7zaTpwP8DQ) and promise to do "better" (supposedly).[^1]

I never would have imagined that I would be diving into the intricacies of business management and stock analysis through the lens of VTubers. However, I found myself diving into:

- Financial reports and Investor relations PDFs (e.g., [this one](https://contents.xj-storage.jp/xcontents/AS05169/6f83629b/c529/4e98/bcd5/a72ee44bcd82/20240513134452391s.pdf))
- Related discussions and analyses on Reddit[^2] and YouTube (including some discussions in the Yahoo Finance JP forums)
- Concepts from the insights of knowledgeable individuals online

All thanks to wonderful people who are willing to share their knowledge on the internet. The last time I was perusing these kinds of documents was when I was in college and researching material for the [2022 Bangkok Business Challenge](https://fb.watch/ehcWDuPn5L).[^3]

## A Unique Learning Opportunity

The situation presented a clear-cut example of what not to do in business, with **Kurosanji** serving as a cautionary tale, and their competitor providing a better example of company management and talent handling. The absurdity of the situation created a valuable learning opportunity for me. It also made for highly entertaining drama about the company's fumbles, to be honest. I was at one point waiting to see if the stock price of **Kurosanji** would plummet further below their lowest all-time low. Seeing a cliff in the stock price chart was funnier than I expected especially when you know the context.[^4]

The situation is **_absurd_** (emphasized and bolded text absurd), with many aspects to _cover_. While I won't further delve into the details here, it's worth noting that **Kurosanji**'s actions with this disaster as well as following blunders have effectively closed their avenue for overseas growth. Given how the VTuber market is already saturated in Japan, this is a significant blow to the company's future prospects.


In a nutshell, I never would have imagined that I would be learning about business management and stock analysis through the lens of VTubers. The situation with **Kurosanji** has provided a unique learning opportunity for me, and I'm grateful for the insights I've gained from the discussions and analyses I've encountered online. It's a reminder that you can find valuable learning opportunities in the most unexpected places, and that the internet is a treasure trove of knowledge waiting to be encountered. 

As the drama unfolds, all eyes are now on **Kurosanji**'s upcoming 2023-2024 Q4 financial report, expected to be released in June or July 2024. Given the events of the past few months from February to May, you might want to stock up on popcorn and get comfortable until then.

[^1]: Consider that in the context of Japanese culture, bowing and apologizing is a big deal, especially with how low the CEO bowed in the video. And although it's a sign of deep regret and shame for the actions of the company, the sincerity of the apology is still up for debate given the phrasing of the apology. The apology was also directed at investors and not the audience (their main "customers"), which is a bit of a red flag.

[^2]: Examples of online resources that helped me learn include: [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1cqspxg/holos_q4_results_have_dropped_time_to_feast/), [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1bjy7qv/comment/kvyl2rf/), [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1btujhh/comment/kxohmia), [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/kurosanji/comments/1bi6lv6/they_were_limiting_who_could_sell_the_stocks/), and many others that I could not seem to locate the link again.
