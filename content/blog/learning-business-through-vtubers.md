## My Journey into the Vtuber Rabbit Hole

In one of my procrastination web surfing journeys, I stumbled upon the world of Vtubers through the serendipity of the YouTube recommendation algorithm. At first, it was just the funny clips, memes, and video game streams. However, I was pulled deeper into the rabbit hole when **Kurosanji**, a Vtuber company, recently faced backlash in February 2024 due to a _extremely_ poor and distasteful PR move involving one of their talents. As I delved deeper into the situation, I found myself reading comments on Reddit and YouTube, as well as watching video reports on the worsening situation for **Kurosanji**. This led me to encounter various discussion points related to:

- Business fundamentals and stock analysis
- Business and talent management
- Public relations and community engagement
- Legal aspects, including contract nuances on enforceable clauses and local/international jurisdictional implications

I never would have imagined that I would be diving into the intricacies of business management and stock analysis through the lens of Vtubers. However, I found myself diving into:

- Financial reports and Investor relations PDFs (e.g., [this one](https://contents.xj-storage.jp/xcontents/AS05169/6f83629b/c529/4e98/bcd5/a72ee44bcd82/20240513134452391s.pdf))
- Related discussions and analyses on Reddit[^1] and YouTube
- Concepts from the insights of knowledgeable individuals online

All thanks to wonderful people who are willing to share their knowledge on the internet. The last time I was perusing these kinds of documents was when I was in college and researching material for the [2022 Bangkok Business Challenge](https://fb.watch/ehcWDuPn5L).[^2]

## A Unique Learning Opportunity

The situation presented a clear-cut example of what not to do in business, with **Kurosanji** serving as a cautionary tale, and their competitor providing a better example of company management and talent handling. The absurdity of the situation created a valuable learning opportunity for me. It also made for highly entertaining drama about the company's fumbles, to be honest. I was at one point waiting to see if the stock price of **Kurosanji** would plummet further below their lowest all-time low. Seeing a cliff in the stock price chart was funnier than I expected especially when you know the context.[^3]

The situation is **_absurd_** (emphasized and bolded text absurd), with many aspects to _cover_ (heh). While I won't delve into the details here, it's worth noting that **Kurosanji**'s blunders have effectively closed their avenue for overseas growth, and even prompted a statement from the Japanese government on not mixing alcohol and caffeinated drinks.

I had some public speaking experience and had to learn some business concepts for the competition. This was a tangent related to my group's thesis project.
