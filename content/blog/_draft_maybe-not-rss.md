## Trying out Miniflux

In the past few days, I have tried self-hosting [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app) on Fly.io to see if I can get a better experience on the web with RSS feeds. There's a lot of interesting sites out there and my aim was to centralize where I get my news and updates from. I imported a bunch of feeds from my Inoreader account as well as other sources and started categorizing them. Google Podcasts was also getting killed off recently so I thought I could also use Miniflux to migrate my podcast subscriptions as well. It seemed great for a while and I even had custom CSS applied to make the reading experience better.

## The RSS feeds are also a waterfall

In the recent few days, I have noticed that I have not been opening Miniflux as much as I thought I would. I have been opening my email, Facebook Messenger, and Viber more often to check for updates. I have also been opening my browser on my phone more often to check for updates on my favorite sites like Hacker News, Reddit, and Discord. I have also been opening the YouTube app more often to check for new videos. And I could go on and on...

What all of these have in common is that they all have feeds/timelines as well like a waterfall with never-ending content as I scroll down more and more. Miniflux also seems the same with how there's a lot of unread entries that greet me when I open it. Unlike the aforementioned apps though it's not unlimited scrolling but it's still a lot of content to go through (the number indicator makes it worse).[^1] It feels like a chore having to sift through them. This is because Miniflux is quite minimalist unlike the aforementioned apps that maximize user engagement through UX design. But it's still feels like a chore.

## RSS is not mainstream

I do believe RSS feeds are great way to centralize content and put it into the hands of the user of how they want to curate content on the web. It's not locked into any platform and is a well-established standard of the world wide web. However, for me it's not practical. The actual content that I want updates on like news and announcements from organizations are not available via RSS feeds. Most of the announcements are on social media and chat groups, particularly Facebook and Facebook Messenger.

Most of the people responsible for publishing the content I want updates on are not using RSS feeds. They are laypeople who are not tech-savvy and are not aware of the existence of RSS feeds.[^2] They are using mainstream social media and chat apps to publish their content. I have to go to where the content is and not wait for it to come to me. This defeats the purpose for me using RSS feeds in the first place. I'm still jumping from one app/website to another to check for updates. I'm still not in control of my web experience.

As much as I want to use RSS feeds, it's not practical for me to keep coming back to it. And even if I do, I still have to go to the actual site most of the time to read the full article because the feed only contains a snippet of the article. Of course, I understand that webmasters want to drive traffic to their site since I have my own website. I might as well just go to the site directly and read the article there.

## RSS feeds are episodic, not continuous

Most of the time when I'm surfing the web, I'm usually searching for something specific. I'm not just scrolling through a feed of content. I'm looking for something that I want to learn and know more about. Whether that's a Wikipedia rabbit hole, a series of interesting blog posts on a niche topic, or long YouTube tutorials, the topic is continuous across different webpages.

In contrast to RSS feeds, the abrupt change in topic from one feed to another is jarring. It's like watching a TV show and then suddenly changing the channel to another show. It reminded me of Tiktok and YouTube Shorts.[^3] Unlike Tiktok and YouTube Shorts, reading is much more effortful so you need to make sure that the content is worth reading. Even though I look through content aggregators like Hacker News, Reddit, or YouTube, I do spend a significant time on a topic because I also look through the comments and do some searches here and there to verify the information. I don't just scroll through the feed and then move on to the next feed. Contrast this to the posts on RSS feeds, most often than not the blog posts on there have little to no discussion to them. I only have the author's perspective and that's it. No counterarguments, no additional information, no other point of view. For me, it feels like there's something missing.

[^1]: I suppose this is a feature, not a bug. Perhaps, it's supposed to discourage you from reading too much and curating what you read more carefully.

[^2]: Face it: RSS feeds are a known standard on the web but it's pretty niche. Normies don't know about the feature unless they grew up with the world wide web before the era of Web 2.0 with the likes of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.

[^3]: Brrr... Just thinking of the brainrot gave me the chills.
