{{ admonition(type="warning", text="There has been significant improvement in the programs, extensions, and plugins mentioned here since I last wrote this post. Some things don't apply anymore.") }}

1. [`typst.vim`][typst-vim] has been updated to support contexts, so the [caveat for the UltiSnips snippets](#caveats) is no longer needed.
2. I've added [LuaSnip] snippets for Typst as well. I decided to use LuaSnip now instead of UltiSnips since it's faster and more suitable for Neovim. Also, it's because I don't know what I'm doing with my Neovim config for UltiSnips and is a huge timesink.
3. Hypersnips snippets currently don't work with the Typst LSP, since the textmate scopes are not available again. There's an [open issue](https://github.com/nvarner/typst-lsp/issues/375) for this in the Typst LSP repo.

~~Recently, I noticed that the [VS Code extension for the Typst LSP][typst-lsp] added support for `textmate scopes`, which means that I can now use [HyperSnips] snippets for my [Typst] files![^1]~~ On another note, there's also a [proof-of-concept support][typst-vim-51] for contexts with the [`typst.vim`](https://github.com/kaarmu/typst.vim) plugin in Neovim, just like in the [`vimtex plugin`][vimtex]. Now making it possible to have [UltiSnips] work with Typst files as well.

Seeing as writing snippets for Typst is now possible with Neovim and/or VS Code. I set out last night to convert some of the snippets in [Gilles Castel's original blog post on his LaTeX snippets][castel-post] that I found useful for my own use.

## Caveats

~~A caveat though to using the UltiSnips snippets in [Neo]vim is that the [`typst.vim` plugin](https://github.com/kaarmu/typst.vim) installation must be tied to commit `96f58d5`[^2].~~

On the other hand, the caveat for the HyperSnips snippets is that there is no such thing as a "`VISUAL`" mode in VS Code, so the snippets that rely on it won't work. To work around this, I used [a suggested solution in the HyperSnips repo][visual-workaround] making use of the VS Code API which replaces the `VISUAL` mode with TextMate's `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` variable.[^3]

<!-- Footnotes -->

[^1]: HyperSnips is a snippet engine for VS Code heavily inspired by vim's [UltiSnips].
[^2]: At least until it's implemented in the main branch of the `typst.vim` plugin.
[^3]: An example is [this snippet](https://github.com/jskherman/dotfiles/blob/4d6d95a249d68c7ebc4b104375b04c53a42e9987/hsnips/typst.hsnips#L391-L394) which surrounds selected text with parentheses.
[^4]: Currently unusable, because of the lack of TextMate scopes in the Typst LSP still.
[^5]: I don't use Ultisnips anymore, see [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md)
